Hi, this is Xin Liu whose English name is Peter Lau. Welcome to my personal blog.

I'm fond of reading, particularly interested in history and literature besides computer science books.

I worked on as an AI engineer in SenseTime for five years after graduation, now I am a software developer in Bytedance.
